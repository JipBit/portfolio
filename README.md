# 🪐 Jeez's Portfolio
This is my porfolio that is constantly being updated because I can never make up my mind.

If you like the look of it, feel free to fork it and re-use it as you wish. Maybe credit me while you're at it too. Can't really control you from not, but it would be greatly appreciated. Instructions on how to install can be found below:

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
